Assignment #2: Reflection

Your Role:
Reflect on the role you were assigned in your group (Project Manager, Software Quality Assurance, UI/UX Designer, or Developer). Write about how you contributed to the project, what challenges you faced in this role, and what you learned.
- The role that I was assigned is Software Quality Assurance (SQA). My role has an important contribution to our project. Through testing, we ensure that we are acquiring quality standards that align with our clients expectations, and we check how well requirements are met. We also help in early detection of defect that allows us to fixed it timely and prevent the problem to accumulate or get worsen. The challenges that I faced was I am not that familiar to this role and it takes a lot of time studying it. Also, the challenging part of this role is the creation of countless test cases and scenarios, which is kind of hard for me and overwhelming because you have to be detailed and ensure you have not missed out on any details. I have learned that this role was not easy, and you really have to be careful in testing because a single missed or overlooked defect can ruin the entire website or final product of your project.

Teamwork Experience:
Share your experience working as part of a team. What went well? What could be improved? Reflect on how well the team communicated, delegated tasks, and collaborated to achieve the project goals.
-As the others say, there is no perfect team, and that is true. Our team was not getting along at first, and one of the main reasons is the communication. The other roles were not communicating well, and it caused a lot of postponements to our progress that also created a double effort to fix the Figma and the website. Another thing was the domino effect of the postponement of that one task, which affected the other task, causing a lot of time-wasting and leading to cramming. But at the end, unity remains in our team, we have already discussed it internally about the communication problem and we reflect to our shortcomings and past mistakes. I can say that all of them are participative, and they do their tasks responsibly, and right now I think we have learned our lessons.

Personal Growth and Discipline:
Think about the disciplines you want to improve. 
- As a Software Quality Assurance member, I want to enhance knowledge in terms of this role by familiarizing myself and understanding it by doing different kinds of testing. Writing test cases, test scenarios, and test plans with clarity and attention to detail is another thing to work on. Lastly, I want to enhance my soft skills, such as communication, collaboration, and critical thinking skills, and avoid procrastination.
