1. Introduction 
My name is Sherelyn Cuanan, I am 20 years old. The programming languages I know are Java, Python, SQL, JavaScript, and PHP. These languages are hard for me to learn and I am not very good at coding because it is difficult for me. I also know some technologies like generative AI, Internet of Things, and virtual and augmented reality etc. I have learned these through studying in school and researching. Despite this, I haven’t done back end development because I mostly focus on front end development, but I have used Node.js for our project. Although coding can be difficult for me, I will try my best to enhance my abilities and expand my skills in both front-end and back-end development with the help of my instructor, classmates, and God.. 
2. Course Expectations 
I have faced difficulties with coding since day one, but I hope to improve my skills and learn something new in this course, especially in backend development. My goal is not only to become better at coding but also to apply what I learn in the industry I will join after completing the course. I am eager to gain more knowledge and skills in Node.js, as it is a vital tool in backend development. Additionally, I am interested in how APIs work and how to create them effectively to connect different applications.
I also want to understand SQL deeply because I believe that managing data is crucial in backend development. Knowing how to work with databases will allow me to handle large amounts of information and ensure that applications can run smoothly. Moreover, I want to learn how to protect that data from cyber attacks, as security is an essential aspect of backend development.
Learning backend development can provide great benefits for my career and studies in numerous ways. It teaches me how to build websites and applications that people use every day. This skill is important because technology is everywhere and leads to many job opportunities. I see backend development as more than just a technical skill, it forms a solid foundation that will enhance my abilities as a developer and give me an edge in the competitive job market. Gaining this knowledge will significantly enhance my education and increase my career opportunities in the future.
3. Challenges and Areas for Improvement 
There are some topics that I find hard to apply in actual coding. One of the biggest challenges I faced last semester was error handling. It felt overwhelming, and I struggled to understand how to fix the mistakes in my code. Additionally, I want to improve my skills in data management. When my instructor first covered this topic in my first year, it didn’t make sense to me. However, I’ve since realized how important data management is in programming.
To overcome these difficulties and improve my learning, I plan to ask my instructors questions about anything I don’t understand. I believe that asking for help will clarify my doubts and help me grasp the concepts better. I also intend to do research and continue studying until I fully understand the topics that are unclear to me. This approach will help me grow as a student.
4. Expectations from the Instructor 
As my instructor, I hope you can provide clear explanations of the topics we cover. It would be helpful if you could give us coding examples that show how to apply what we learn in real projects. I also appreciate when you share tutorials or additional resources that can help deepen my understanding. Sometimes, I learn better through hands-on practice, so any coding exercises or challenges would be great. I would love to have open communication with you, where I can ask questions and get help whenever I struggle with a concept. Your support would really help me pass and succeed in this course.
5. Final Thoughts 
I want to share my specific goals for this course. Honestly, I really hate coding, but I hope that you can help change that and help me start to like it. My aim is to have a solid understanding of backend development, especially in working with Node.js and databases. Additionally, I want to improve my problem-solving abilities, particularly in areas like error handling. Overall, I want to gain confidence in my coding skills and I hope you can help me with that sir hehe.
